/**
 * Class that manages a connection to a [MediaBrowserServiceCompat] instance, typically a
 * [MusicService] or one of its subclasses.
 *
 * Typically it's best to construct/inject dependencies either using DI or, as UAMP does,
 * using [InjectorUtils] in the app module. There are a few difficulties for that here:
 * - [MediaBrowserCompat] is a final class, so mocking it directly is difficult.
 * - A [MediaBrowserConnectionCallback] is a parameter into the construction of
 *   a [MediaBrowserCompat], and provides callbacks to this class.
 * - [MediaBrowserCompat.ConnectionCallback.onConnected] is the best place to construct
 *   a [MediaControllerCompat] that will be used to control the [MediaSessionCompat].
 *
 *  Because of these reasons, rather than constructing additional classes, this is treated as
 *  a black box (which is why there's very little logic here).
 *
 *  This is also why the parameters to construct a [MusicServiceConnection] are simple
 *  parameters, rather than private properties. They're only required to build the
 *  [MediaBrowserConnectionCallback] and [MediaBrowserCompat] objects.
